**Xin chào, tớ là Mai Hương.**  
**Hello, I'm Mai.**  
**Bonjour C'est Mai.**  
**안녕하세요 Mai 입니다.**

I come from [**Vietnam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam), a small (but nice) country in Asia. I started my journey from my homeland, then South Korea and now is France. In details, I received my B.S degree in electronics and Telecommunications from the [**Hanoi University of Science and Technology**](https://hust.edu.vn/) in 2020. Then I completed my M.S degree in Computer Science at [**Soongsil University**](https://ssu.ac.kr/) in 2024.Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D and working as a member of our SEPIA team at [**IRIT**](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/), Toulouse, France. My previous work includes mobile edge computing, deep reinforcement learning and optimization while my current work focuses on distributed systems, energy consumption and federated learning.

Know me in my works
======
- **Distributed computing system, energy measurement, federated learning**: these are the areas I'm currently focused on, so it would be great if we had similar interests or topics to discuss.

- **Deep reinforcement learning, optimization modelling, edge computing**: which is my master's topic, currently I am not deeply researching this one but it is related to my current works, come and discuss if you want to share your interesting things.

- **Antennas, radio frequencies, wireless communications**: aeras I worked on in the past and although I no longer focus on these, I still enjoy hearing news and updates in these fields.

Know me beyond my works
======
- In my free time, I enjoy hiking, listening to music, traveling, and I have a great passion for delicious food.

- My personal motto is: "*Follow your heart's desires.*" Then my heart said, "*Eat, Relax, and Wait to grow old.*"
