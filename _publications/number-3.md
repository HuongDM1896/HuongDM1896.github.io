**ABSTRACT** The collaboration of MEC systems is now necessary for MEC service providers to handle service continuity in multi-operator operating scenarios. The so-called MEC federation is a type of collaboration. This report provides background information on MEC federation systems' best practices for resource allocation and energy use. The minimization problem is resolved using a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient. The simulation was also put up to gauge how well our suggestion worked.
